# Employee_Categorization
A project based on categorizing employees based on their different features in the company using unsupervised machine-learning models.
- Data wrangling was done to transform the data set into usable format for prediction and analysis.
- The transformed dataset was scaled, the model selction was based on reducing overfitting.
- KMeans Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering  models were selected for the unsupervised learning prediction.
- Applied Features selection for precise prediction and analysis based on the Attrition column in the dataset.
- Visualization of Certain features for Informed Analysis of performance of both KMeans & Agglomerative model predictions.
- Deductions were made from the KMeans and the Agglomerative prediction analysis.
- Visualization of the KMeans model prediction versus Agglomerative model prediction.
